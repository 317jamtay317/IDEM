## Architectural Patterns ✅

### Clean Architecture
Layered, with dependencies pointing inward toward the domain:

```
Api ─── Application ─── Domain
  └─── Infrastructure ───┘
```

- **Domain** — entities, value objects, aggregates, domain events, invariants. No infrastructure dependencies.
- **Application** — commands, queries, handlers, DTOs, orchestration. No business logic.
- **Infrastructure** — EF Core, SQL Server, external services, repository implementations.
- **Api** — HTTP surface (Minimal API or controllers), OpenAPI metadata.

### CQRS via Wolverine
Commands change state and emit domain events; queries are read-only and may bypass the domain model for read-side performance where it pays.

### Domain-Driven Design
Ubiquitous language, aggregates as consistency boundaries, repositories per aggregate root, domain events for cross-aggregate effects. See [UbiquitousLanguage.md](./UbiquitousLanguage.md) and [Invariants.md](./Invariants.md).

### Test-Driven Development
- Tests written **before** implementation.
- All public and protected code documented.
- **Minimum 80% code coverage**, enforced in CI. PRs failing the threshold do not merge.

## Patterns Borrowed from BillingAgent ✅

Copy as **templates, not as code** (per handoff decision — no wholesale fork of BillingAgent):

- Wolverine + transactional outbox wiring
- Integration test pattern: shared `*ApiFactory` per test assembly, `ResetForTest()` per test, Testcontainers SQL Server
- Postman collection + OpenAPI conventions for endpoint documentation
- `ErrorOr<T>` for business-outcome results; exceptions reserved for genuinely unexpected failures
- `FluentValidation` with `WithErrorCode("I-D##")` tying validation failures to specific invariant IDs in [Invariants.md](./Invariants.md)
- `CLAUDE.md` / `UbiquitousLanguage.md` / `Invariants.md` doc conventions

## Auth ✅

**ASP.NET Core Identity + OpenIddict**, embedded in `RecordKeeping.Api` (no separate auth service). OAuth 2.1 **Authorization Code + PKCE** flow for the React SPA. Refresh tokens delivered as `HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite=Strict` cookies; access tokens held in SPA memory only.

**Identity tables** live in a dedicated `auth` schema in the SQL Server database, separating them visually from domain tables. Passwords are stored using Identity's default PBKDF2 with HMAC-SHA-512 (see [I-D14](./Invariants.md)).

**Access-token claims.** Issued access tokens carry the subject, email, name, and an `is_site_admin` flag. Org Users additionally carry an `org_id` claim (the caller's Org); it is absent for SiteAdmins, who have no Org ([I-D13](./Invariants.md)). Org-scoped self-service endpoints (e.g. `/me/org/facilities`) derive the Org from `org_id` rather than from client input, enforcing Org isolation ([I-D03](./Invariants.md)) by construction.

**SPA OIDC client**: `react-oidc-context` wraps `oidc-client-ts` and provides the React hooks and route guards used by `src/client`. Silent refresh runs in an iframe.

**Entra ID federation** is a per-Org feature: an Org with `Org.TenantId` (the Entra directory GUID) set redirects to its Entra ID directory for login; OpenIddict consumes Entra ID via the standard `AddOpenIdConnect()` middleware, then issues local RecordKeeping tokens. Orgs without `Org.TenantId` use local username/password (see [I-D12](./Invariants.md)).

**MFA**: TOTP-based via Identity's built-in authenticator support. Deferred from the v1 auth slice; required before the first paying customer.

> **Decision history.** The original handoff lean was *plain ASP.NET Core Identity (cookies)* on the grounds that RecordKeeping is a single-product SaaS and not an OIDC server for third parties. Overridden in favor of OpenIddict to keep the SPA on a real OAuth flow — forward-compatible with future mobile clients, partner integrations, and federated SSO without later flow rewrites.

## MCP (Model Context Protocol) ✅

RecordKeeping exposes an **MCP server** so external AI agents — **Claude**, **ChatGPT**, and **GitHub Copilot** — can call into the product. It lives in the `RecordKeeping.Mcp` project and is **embedded in `RecordKeeping.Api`** (mounted at `/mcp` over the **Streamable HTTP** transport, stateless mode). Built on the official `ModelContextProtocol.AspNetCore` SDK.

**Effortless auth is the headline requirement.** It maps onto the MCP authorization spec, which is OAuth 2.1 with three discovery layers — so an agent needs only the one URL `https://<host>/mcp`:

1. **Protected Resource Metadata** (RFC 9728) at `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource/mcp`, and a `WWW-Authenticate: Bearer resource_metadata="…"` header on every 401. This points the agent at the authorization server.
2. **Authorization Server Metadata** (RFC 8414) — served by OpenIddict at both `/.well-known/openid-configuration` and `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server` (agents probe the latter).
3. **Dynamic Client Registration** (RFC 7591) at `/connect/register` — the agent self-registers a `client_id`, then runs Authorization Code + PKCE. No per-agent configuration, no shared secrets.

**Embedded topology (resource server == authorization server).** The MCP endpoint is an OAuth resource server that trusts tokens this same app issues. Co-hosting removes cross-service token-audience juggling and a second deployable. The MCP code stays in its own project (peer to `Api`) and ships its own `RecordKeeping.Mcp.slnx` view.

**Authorization wiring.** A dedicated `McpAuth` authentication scheme publishes the resource metadata and emits the discovery challenge, but **forwards token validation to the OpenIddict validation scheme** — so global auth defaults (and the SPA flow) are untouched. The `/mcp` endpoint is guarded by the **`McpUser`** policy: authenticated **and** the access token carries the **`mcp` scope**.

**Dynamic Client Registration is implemented in-house** (`DynamicClientRegistration` in Infrastructure) because OpenIddict has no registration endpoint. Open registration is the price of frictionless onboarding, so every dynamically-registered client is **hardened**: public (no secret), **PKCE required**, limited to **authorization-code + refresh-token**, with redirect URIs restricted to **HTTPS or loopback**.

**Resource validation is disabled** on the OpenIddict server. MCP clients (RFC 8707) always send a `resource` parameter equal to the MCP URL, which is host-dynamic and not pre-registered; without this, OpenIddict would reject those token requests with `invalid_target`. Because the resource server and authorization server are the same app, audience binding isn't load-bearing for security here — the **`mcp` scope** is the authorization gate. Tightening to explicit audience/resource binding is a future option.

> **Deferred before first external agent in production:** persistent signing/encryption keys (currently ephemeral), the existing TLS-edge `UseForwardedHeaders` hardening, and a consent screen (registration currently uses implicit consent to match the SPA). Tracked alongside the existing pre-prod auth TODOs.

## Multi-Org ❓

Org isolation strategy not yet decided. Three options on the table:

1. **Shared schema + `OrgId` column** — standard SaaS pattern, simplest to operate. Default unless we have a reason to deviate. Enforced via global EF query filters and the [I-D03](./Invariants.md) negative-test rule.
2. Schema-per-Org
3. Database-per-Org

Pick one before writing the first migration. Whichever strategy lands must satisfy [I-D03](./Invariants.md): no cross-Org data leakage at any layer.

## Legacy Migration 🟡

Legacy WPF app uses **SQL Server**, so migration is SQL→SQL — schema lift vs. fresh schema with ETL is still open. Decision rests on how clean the legacy schema is and whether DDD aggregates map cleanly onto it.

---

## In-house Reporting ✅

No third-party commercial reporting vendor (per handoff decision). Report Engine and Report Templates are built in-house. OSS primitives at the lowest level (PdfSharp/MigraDoc, SkiaSharp/ScottPlot, ClosedXML, react-grid-layout/react-rnd) are in scope; commercial report designers requiring per-Org or per-seat licensing are not.
